This project demonstrates how AWS services can be combined to create a cloud-based **Learning Management System (LMS)** for educational insights.

### 🔧 Technologies Used:
- **Amazon S3** – LMS data storage  
- **Amazon Athena** – Query structured data  
- **Amazon QuickSight** – Dashboard and visualizations  
- **AWS IAM** – Secure access and permission control  
- *(Optional future extension: AWS Lambda, DynamoDB)*

## 📈 Key Features

- ✅ Track completion status of learning tasks
- 📅 Monitor created and completed dates
- 📊 Display progress KPIs such as average completion rates
- 🔍 Interactive filters (by task ID, status, date)
- 📤 Dashboard published and shareable with public access

---

## 💡 Future Scope

We plan to build a **simple frontend webpage** using **React or HTML/CSS** that will:
- Allow users to **input new task data** (category, task name, status)
- Push submitted data to **S3 / DynamoDB**
- Automatically update QuickSight dashboards via data refresh
